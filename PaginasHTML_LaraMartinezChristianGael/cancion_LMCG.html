Break em'<br>
Shit!<br>
Yo!<br>
Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God<br>
I don't know but today seems kinda odd<br>
No barking from the dogs, no smog<br>
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog<br>
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out<br>
Finally, got a call from a girl wanna dig out<br>
Hooked it up on later as I hit the do´<br>
Thinking will I live, another twenty-fo'<br>
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top<br>
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop<br>
Had to stop at a red light<br>
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight<br>
And everything is alright<br>
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night<br>
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all<br>
Which court, are y'all playin' basketball?<br>
Get me on the court and I'm trouble<br>
Last week fucked around and got a triple double<br>
Freaking niggas everyway like M. J<br>
I can't believe, today was a good day<br><br><br>
Drove to the pad and hit the showers<br>
Didn't even get no static from the cowards<br>
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me<br>
Saw the police and they rolled right past me<br>
No flexin', didn't even look in a niggaz direction<br>
As I ran the intersection<br>
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps<br>
What's the haps on the craps<br>
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em<br>
Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em<br>
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven<br>
Seven even back do' Little Joe I picked up the cash flow<br>
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' domino<br>
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L. A<br>
Today was a good day<br><br><br>
Left my niggaz house paid<br>
Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the twelve grade<br>
It's ironic, I had the booze she had the chronic<br>
The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big fat fanny<br>
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the poor nanny<br>
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep<br>
Put her ass to sleep<br>
Woke her up around one<br>
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun<br>
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting<br>
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion<br>
I was glad everything had worked out<br>
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out<br>
Today was like one of those fly dreams<br>
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams<br>
No helicopter looking for a murder<br>
Two in the morning got the fat burger<br>
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp<br>
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp<br>
Drunk as hell but no throwing up<br>
Halfway home and my pager still blowing up<br>
Today I didn't even have to use my A. K<br>
I got to say it was a good day<br><br><br>
Hey wait, wait a minute fool<br>
Stop the shit<br>
What the fuck am I thinking about?<br>
